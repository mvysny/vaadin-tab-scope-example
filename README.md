# Vaadin Tab-Scope Example App

A demo project demoing a proper way of having tab-scoped values and routes.
No Spring - pure Servlet project.

In Vaadin 8, things were simple: both `UI` and `UI.init()` was working predictably:
the UI was instantiated once per tab (when using `@PreserveOnRefresh`), and the init
listener ran exactly once, before everything else, and so it was the right place to perform initialization.

In Vaadin 23+, this is no longer the case. You don't use UI almost at all, the only
sane way to use `UI` is to store data to it via `ComponentUtil` ,
and there is a `UIInitListener`. However, even with `@PreserveOnRefresh`, the `UI`
won't survive reload and thus the init listener is called multiple times.

Please see the [Tab Scope](https://mvysny.github.io/vaadin-ui-scope/) blog post
and [issue #13468](https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues/13468) for more details.
